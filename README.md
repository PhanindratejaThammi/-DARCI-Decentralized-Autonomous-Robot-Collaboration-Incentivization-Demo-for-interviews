# DARCI: Decentralized Autonomous Robot Collaboration Incentivization Demo for interviews.

This repository presents the **final demonstration video** of the DARCI framework developed as part of my Master's Thesis at Texas A&M University. Due to copyright restrictions, source files and documentation are not public. However, this video captures the end-to-end capabilities and outcomes of the system.

## 🔍 Project Overview

**DARCI (Decentralized Autonomous Robot Collaboration & Incentivization)** is a novel framework that enables autonomous multi-robot collaboration in dynamic environments using blockchain-based smart contracts and sensor-driven adjudication for fair task incentivization.

This system demonstrates a secure, transparent, and efficient decentralized solution to challenges in robot cooperation, incentive distribution, and real-time dynamic task handling.

## 🎯 Key Contributions

- **Blockchain-based Task Contracts:** Robots autonomously evaluate and accept contracts deployed on Ethereum, adjusting for task complexity and deadlines using a novel predictive reward decay model.

- **Dynamic Incentive Allocation:** Two types of tasks are supported:
  - **Delivery Tasks** – rewarded based on time.
  - **Coverage Tasks** – rewarded based on area contribution.
  
- **Real-Time Sensor-Based Adjudication:** Tasks are verified using ArUco marker tracking, ensuring autonomous and fair performance validation without human intervention.

- **Collaborative Task Execution:** Robots dynamically divide areas and execute tasks with efficient multi-agent coordination. Task complexity, energy, and effort determine reward splits.

- **Restaurant Use Case Demonstration:** Tasks such as parcel delivery and cleaning within a simulated restaurant layout demonstrate system reliability in real-world inspired environments.

## 🚀 Features Demonstrated in the Video

- Multi-robot navigation using **ROS2**, **SLAM (GMapping)**, and **Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)** for obstacle avoidance.
- Blockchain smart contract deployment and task selection.
- Task-specific real-time adjudication and incentivization protocol.
- Simulation vs. real-world robot task execution comparison.
- Visualizations using **Gazebo** and **Rviz** showing path planning, robot coordination, map merging, and performance tracking.

This video captures all aspects of the DARCI framework in action — from task allocation to contract generation, robot coordination, and dynamic incentivization.

## 🏆 Results

| Metric                        | DARCI Framework | Baseline (Random) |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Tasks Completed in 2 mins   | High            | Low               |
| Total Earnings              | High            | Low               |
| Reward Fairness             | Verified        | Not Applicable    |
| Task Completion Time        | Efficient       | Inconsistent      |
| Real-World to Sim Match     | ~90% Accuracy   | -                 |

DARCI clearly outperforms random methodologies in task throughput, fairness, and economic performance.
